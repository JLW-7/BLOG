## About Me

Hey, I’m July, a 13-year-old student developer based in Shanghai. I build software and hardware to solve real problems and create meaningful things for others, whether that impact is small and personal or broader in scale.  

Beyond programming, I have many other interests. I don’t see them as separate. Sports, science, music, and technology constantly intersect.

## Programming and Building

Programming is the tool I rely on most. I began teaching myself in fifth grade, intrigued that ideas could become real stuff through computers, which is why I'm dedicated to making a positive impact on others. I like the quiet satisfaction in building a system that makes sense both in your mind and on the screen.  

I am especially interested in **artificial intelligence and machine learning**. What excites me is not just what these systems can do, but how they work. I like digging beneath the abstractions, understanding why a model behaves the way it does, and seeing how mathematics, data, and design choices shape outcomes.  

I rarely try to understand everything at once. I'm almost always building and breaking stuff at the same time. That cycle is far more fun than following a straight path.

## Swimming

Outside of programming, I am a competitive swimmer and represent Shanghai in national and international competitions. I have been training since age six, practicing 6 times a week for 2-4 hrs per session. 

Training is pretty repetitive and physically demanding. Much of it is just staring at the same tiles, repeating the same motions, and focusing on tiny details. Every stroke's experiment, and every practice offers something new to learn, even when you're exhausted. Progress comes not from dramatic breakthroughs, but from discipline, consistency, and attention to detail.

### My Journey

My path has never been smooth, and resilience has mattered just as much as talent. I have faced moments of intense pain and challenges that felt impossible to overcome.  

One of the most difficult was my **elbow fracture in 2023**. I underwent two surgeries, had pins inserted into my bones, and spent two months with my arm in a cast. During that time, many people doubted whether I would return to the pool at the same level. Despite the physical and mental strain, I kept pushing forward.  

That effort eventually paid off. I returned to training faster and stronger than expected. Looking back, I am proud not only of the outcome, but of the fact that I never gave up.

That mindset carries into how I approach projects today.

## Other Interests

### Formula 1  
I am an avid Formula 1 fan and recently began following the sport closely. My favorite team is Red Bull Racing, and my favorite driver is Max Verstappen! Studying race strategy and the engineering behind the cars has strengthened my strategic thinking and deepened my understanding of physics.

### Violin  
I play the violin in my school orchestra and chamber music group. I have been learning since the age of five, which taught me early on that precision and expression can coexist.

### Astrophysics  
I am deeply interested in astrophysics (you know black holes, galaxies, and all that). I sometimes stargaze through my professional telescope in my backyard.

### Investment  
I enjoy learning about investing and economics. I research companies and practice using simulators, which has helped me think long-term and adapt to uncertainty.

### Music Composition  
I create electronic music using GarageBand and Logic Pro, inspired by my favorite artists. It's mainly just for me to experiment and relax.

### Wushu  
I love to practice Wushu, a traditional form of Chinese martial arts, which helps me develop focus and control. I perform occasionally at school events and especially enjoy sword routines.

### Volleyball  
Volleyball once played a major role in my life. I played as a middle blocker and setter and learned about **coordination and teamwork**. However in recent years, my focus has shifted primarily to swimming.

## My Goals

My long-term goal is to dive deeper into **artificial intelligence** and become an **AI or machine learning engineer**. I want to go beyond using existing tools and instead understand the systems well enough to build responsibly and thoughtfully.  

I am still at the beginning of that journey, and that excites me. The process of learning matters as much as the result.

## About This Blog

This space is where I document ideas, projects, and insights. I write about things I am building, questions I am stuck on, lessons I learn along the way, and connections I notice across different fields.  

It can also be seen as my regular **self-reflections**, where my thinking evolves over time

> Stick around. My insights are valuable and you should go read them. Oh, have fun, too.
