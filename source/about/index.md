## About Me 😎

I’m July, a 13 year old student developer based in Shanghai. I build software and hardware that can actually solve real-world problems and make a positive difference to others, whether it's those around me, or the whole world.  

I have many [other interests](#other-things-i-care-about) beyond programming. I don’t really see these interests as separate. Programming, sports, science, and music all connect in ways that aren’t obvious at first, but they start to make sense once you spend enough time with them.

## Programming and Building 💻

Programming is the tool I use most often, something I started self-learning in 5th grade. It’s how ideas turn into something concrete. For me, code is not just about functionality, but about structure and clarity. When a system makes sense in your head and also works on a screen, that’s a satisfying moment.  

I’m especially interested in **AI and machine learning**. What draws me in is not just the results, but the underlying mechanics. I like understanding what is actually happening beneath the abstractions, why a model behaves the way it does, and how math, data, and design choices all interact.  

I don’t rush to “know everything.” I usually start by building, get confused, break things, then go back and learn what I was missing.

## Swimming 🏊

Outside of programming, I am a full-time competitive swimmer and represent Shanghai in national and international competitions. Since I was 6, I have been training six times a week, 2–4 hours per session, for over eight years.  

Practice is repetitive, exhausting, and often monotonous. You spend a lot of time staring at the same tiles, doing the same movements, thinking about very small adjustments. Every stroke is an experiment, every day you learn something new although you're completely drained at the end. I believe progress comes from consistency, discipline, and curiosity to details.

### My Journey 💪

My pursuit as a swimming athlete has never been easy, and resilience matters just as much. Throughout my journey, I've been through unimaginable pain and challenges that seem impossible to surmount.  

Take my **2023 elbow fracture** as an example. I had to undergo two surgeries to nail two pins into my bones, and two months with my arm in a cast. When everybody gave up on me, I kept pushing despite both the physical and mental pain of recovery. My efforts paid off in the end, with me returning to the pool faster and stronger than before. Looking back, I am incredibly proud of myself for never giving up or losing hope.  

That mindset carries over into how I work on projects. Improvement is usually slow, but it compounds.

## Other Interests 🌟

### Formula 1 
I am a huge F1 fan, and I have just gotten into it recently. My favorite team is Red Bull Racing with my favorite driver being Max Verstappen. Following race strategies and the engineering behind F1 cars has taught me strategic thinking and important physics concepts..

### Violin 
I play the violin in my school orchestra and chamber music group. I have been learning it since I was 5, which taught me early on that **precision and expression can exist at the same time**.

### Astrophysics 
I’m deeply interested in astrophysics, mostly because of how it forces you to think at completely different scales, and how much there is to explore. It’s hard to worry about small things when you’re thinking about black holes, strange matter, and galaxies.

### Investment 
I love learning about investing and economics. I research stocks and practice by earning (fake) money on simulators, which pushed me to think long term and adapt to uncertainty.

### Music Composition 
I make electronic music in **GarageBand** and **LogicPro**, inspired by my favorite music artists, mostly as a way to experiment and relax.

### Wushu 
I practice Wushu, a form of Chinese martial arts, which helps with focus and control. I do it for fun and usually perform at school on special occasions. I especially love Wushu swordfighting.

### Volleyball 
Volleyball used to be a very important part of my life. I played at school as the Middle-Blocker or Setter, where I learned that **coordination and teamwork matter more than individual skill**. In recent years, I've focused more on swimming.

## My Goals 🚀

My long-term goal is to deeply understand **artificial intelligence** and become an **AI and machine learning engineer**. I’m not just interested in using tools, but in understanding the systems behind them well enough to build responsibly and thoughtfully.  

I’m still early in the process, but that doesn’t bother me. If anything, it makes things more interesting, as to me, the process matters as much as the result.

## About This Blog ✍️

This space is where I write anything that comes to mind as well as insights I believe are valuable sharing. I’ll give tips and advice on any topic of interest, write about projects I’m building, ideas I’m stuck on, things I learned along the way, and connections I notice between different fields.  

It’s less about teaching and more about **self-reflection** and keeping track of how my understanding changes over time.

> Stick around, it'll be fun and I'd love to share my insights with you. Be sure to check out more on my personal website [julyw.com](https://julyw.com/) and follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/JLW-7)!
