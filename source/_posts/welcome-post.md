Hi! I'm July, a student developer and swimming athlete from Shanghai, China. You may learn more about me  [here](/about) or visit my space on the internet [julyw.com](https://julyw.com/). 

## My Blog

I regularly make updates and write articles, usually a few every month. They might about anything I find interesting, whether tutorials, insights, tips or just random thoughts/experiences. 

> By the way, if you like what I write/make/believe, feel free to reach out and connect with me in any form!
