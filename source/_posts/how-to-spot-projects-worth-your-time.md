## Introduction

At some point, most developers run into the same question: *What should I build?* Ideas are easy to come by, but many that seem exciting at first lose their appeal once work begins. Over time, I’ve learned that the real skill is not coming up with ideas, but deciding which ones are worth pursuing.

## Start With Yourself

The projects that last tend to start with a real problem. I find it useful to ask:

- What problems do I encounter repeatedly?
- What topics or activities do I naturally spend time on?
- Where could I combine my interests or skills in a meaningful way?

When a project solves a problem you personally experience, staying motivated becomes much easier.

## Think Small First

Large ideas can be motivating, but they are also easy to abandon. Starting small makes progress more likely.

- Focus on a single, essential feature
- Avoid over-polishing at the beginning
- Use the early version to learn and adjust

A simple, completed project often provides more value than an ambitious one that never ships.

## Ask the Right Questions

Before committing to an idea, I usually take a step back and consider:

- Would I realistically use this myself?
- Does it help me learn or improve a skill?
- Can the idea be understood quickly?
- Do I feel genuinely interested in building it?

If most answers are no, it is usually better to rethink the idea.

## Observation Is Important

Good project ideas often come from improving what already exists:

- Can an existing tool be simplified?
- Could two ideas be combined into something more effective?
- Is there a small, recurring inconvenience that could be removed?

Innovation often comes from noticing details rather than starting from scratch.

## Reality Checks

- Test assumptions early
- Share the idea with people outside your usual circle
- Treat feedback as information, not criticism

Early feedback can reveal problems that are difficult to see when working alone.

## Know When to Move On

It is reasonable to stop working on a project if:

- It is difficult to explain clearly
- There is no interest beyond yourself
- Your curiosity has faded over time

However, it is not always a reason to stop if:

- Similar projects already exist
- The idea has been done before
- Others do not immediately understand it

Not every project is meant for everyone.

## Closing Thoughts

Strong project ideas tend to emerge naturally from everyday frustrations, long-standing interests, or repeated thoughts. Writing ideas down and revisiting them over time helps identify which ones truly matter. The ideas that continue to hold your attention are often the ones worth building.
