title: How to Spot Projects Worth Your Time

> *This post is based on my own experience and observations, written for developers/professionals looking to find and spend time on projects worth building.*

## Introduction

So I've found that at some point, most developers run into the same question: *Now what should I build?* Yeah everyone knows ideas are easy to come by, but **choosing the right ones** are more important. I made this guide to help you find out what kind of projects are worth your time.

## Start With Yourself

This is the most important part: the projects that are meaningful usually start with a real-world problem. You might find it useful to ask:

- What problems do I encounter repeatedly?
- What topics or activities do I naturally spend time on?
- Where could I combine my interests or skills in a meaningful way?

When a project solves a problem you experience yourself, you get motivation much easier.

## Think Small First

Many large ideas can be motivating but difficult, thus easy to abandon. It is better for you to start a smaller project and go step by step. It helps make more progress. You'll want to:

- Focus on a single, essential feature in the beginning
- Avoid over-polishing or overloading at first
- Use the early version to learn and adjust; add more features as you go

I find that a simple, completed project, is often more valuable than a gigantic one that never gets finished. You can use a project building tracker like [CodeLog](https://github.com/JLW-7/CodeLog) or a to-do list to keep track of progress.

## Ask the Right Questions

Now before you commit to an idea, here are some questions for you to go back and consider:

- Would I realistically use this myself in an aspect of life?
- Does building it help me learn or improve something?
- Can this idea be understood by both myself and others?
- Do I feel genuinely interested in and curious about building it?

If most answers are no, it might be better to rethink your idea.

## Observation Is Important

It's important to note that although many good ideas are completely new inventions, some project ideas may come from improving stuff that already exist. Think:

- Can an existing tool be simplified or improved?
- Could two ideas or subjects be combined into something more effective?
- Is there a small, recurring inconvenience in life that could be removed?

Innovation sometimes comes from noticing details rather than starting from scratch.

## Reality Checks

- Test your assumptions early on, before you start committing to the project
- Share the idea with people outside your own circle and collect feedback
- Treat that feedback as information to improve but not criticism

Early feedback from those around you can reveal problems that are difficult to see when you're working alone.

---

## Know When to Move On

At this point, some checks you can do:

Stop working on a project if:

- It is too difficult to explain the project idea clearly
- It's just a random redundant thought instead of a solution to a problem
- No people or communities are interested beyond yourself
- Your curiosity and motivation has faded after some time of working

But don't stop working on it if:

- Similar projects are being done by others (you can build a better)
- The idea already exists in some form (action is more important than ideas)
- Others do not immediately understand it (that's an area of improvement on your idea)

---

## TL;DR

Overall, strong project ideas are ones that emerge **naturally** from your or others' **everyday frustrations, interests, or repeated thoughts**. You may want to note down ideas and come back to them, so over time you can identify which ones you want to work on. 

By the way, you don't *need* to follow this guide, you can come up with your own way of deciding too :)
